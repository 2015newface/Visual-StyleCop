# StyleCop
Copy of StyleCop (andyr) from stylecop.codeplex.com for visual studio 2015

I am cleaning the solution and it should be easier to work than previous version.
No command lines only visual studio 2015 and GitHub.

When it's done I'll allow edition for everyone.

Current pushlied version : 4.7.50
Visual Studio Extension : https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/cac2a05b-6eb6-4fa2-95b9-1f8d011e6cae
